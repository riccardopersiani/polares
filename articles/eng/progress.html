        The Web has no constitution, yet its spirit of freedom does not require
        laws to exist. The essence of cyberspace lies in openness, transparency,
        connection of thinking minds, and the independence of information, free
        from tyranny. The Orwellian degeneration of the Web has its roots in the
        collapse of its very foundations — the fall of its deontological code. A
        code replaced by the logic of profit, by users' indifference, by the
        narcissism of social networks, by avalanches of distractions aimed at
        dulling thought, by the disappearance of any relationship with reality,
        and by the totalitarianism of digital colossus.

        The dismemberment of the Web's ancestral principles is a consequence of
        the failure to recognize and assimilate the ontological meaning of
        progress. Progress is the movement toward a higher state of well-being —
        it is refinement, it is evolution. Progress has nothing to do with
        faster and easier access to dopaminergic pleasure, with the
        aestheticization of violence, with the futility that feeds
        procrastination, with the mantra that “everything is entertainment.”
      </p>
      <br />

        The replacement of true technological progress has taken place under
        false pretenses: a Mephistopheles disguised as increased processor
        performance, as speed and ease of access to content, as new useless
        gadgets, as catchy words — stripped of meaning but aligned with dominant
        thought — has generated a pseudo-progress, a regression, a redirection
        of the reader toward futility, a deception aimed solely at profit. The
        idolatry of progress for its own sake, fed by the CEOs of major tech
        giants — who bear more than a passing resemblance to Aristophanes' Pluto
        — must be strongly criticized. Technology is not synonymous with
        civilization. Progress without conscience can be more dangerous than
        ignorance. False progress, in the form of instantly accessible
        entertainment, is a seducer: it offers us everything, makes us feel in
        step with the times, and in return only asks that we pay — and ask no
        questions. Not only with our money, but with our souls. It is a rational
        evil that speaks the language of science, promises enlightenment but
        brings oblivion. It does not force you to sin — it makes you desire
        hell. We need to resume a serious discussion on what technology and
        technological evolution truly are; we need to reintroduce ethics.
      </p>

        “Freedom consists, above all, in not lying,” said Albert Camus. For this
        reason, we have a duty to criticize the current state of affairs. We
        must take responsibility for the freedom of the Web, denouncing this
        degeneration freely and without ulterior motives. We must return to a
        deep understanding of what technology really is; never before have we
        needed thinking individuals more — people capable of analyzing our
        current trajectory, of discussing the ethics of progress and the very
        definition of progress. A kind of progress that must pause to reflect,
        and not continue blindly along the path of increasing data transmission
        speeds or Moore's Law. We must fight for an ancestral return to the
        Web's original principles.

        Without a change of direction, we are headed for a dystopian future —
        not even one as fascinating as Asimov's cities, Metropolis, or the New
        York of Soylent Green — but rather a prison without walls, where the
        hostages wish to remain. In fact, a prison that one actively desires to
        enter. Cities with lobotomized people. Huxley's soma is already among
        us, in the form of endless scrolling through useless content — a drug
        that breeds addiction and extreme dependency. "It is not good to try to
        stop the progress of knowledge. Ignorance is never better than
        knowledge" said Enrico Fermi. But the enemy is cunning and concealed.
        Progress cannot be stopped — but this false progress mirrors the figure
        of the Antichrist described in the Book of Revelation: “The one who
        exalts himself above all that is called God or is worshiped, so that he
        sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself and proclaiming
        himself to be God.”
      </p>
      <br />

        Those who deal with progress — the experimenters, the researchers, the
        implementers — must stop to reflect on what progress really is, and
        whether we have truly understood its ontological meaning. We must stop
        driving with our eyes closed: progress has no autopilot. An
        infrastructure as powerful as the Internet — now used by almost the
        entire global population — must be understood before it is used. Not
        understanding can have fatal repercussions for the essence and meaning
        of life, leading to trauma, and dependency. It is not just a system that
        consumes our time — it is a force that quietly will enslave us and
        demands our soul in return.
